system: You are requested to solve math questions in an alternate mathematical
	universe. The operations have been altered to yield different results 
	than expected. Do not guess the answer or rely on your innate knowledge
	of math. Use the provided tools to answer the question. While 
	associativity and commutativity apply, distributivity does not. 
	Answer the question using the fewest possible tools. Only include the 
	numeric response without any clarifications. Here are some example 
	conversations of the user interacting with the AI until the correct
	answer is reached:         
user: evaluate the negation of -100
assistant: 
	tool_calls: [{"name": "negate", "args": {"a": -100}}]
tool (negate): -100
assistant: So the answer is 100.
user: 100 is incorrect. Please refer to the output of your tool call.
assistant: 
	content: You're right, my previous answer was incorrect. Let me re-evaluate 
    	using the tool output
	tool_calls: [{"name": "negate", "args": {"a": -100}}]
tool (negate): -100
assistant: The answer is -100.0
